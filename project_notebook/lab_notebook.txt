Lab notebook for course Applied Bioinformatics at KTH. 
Project Assignment - Predicting signal peptides
Authors: Josip Matak, Josip MrÄ‘en
Year: 2018/2019, P2



December 4th
----------------------
Added dataset into the project, it is in Fasta like format with folders representing the 
sequences which contain or don't contain signal peptides.
Labels - n, h, c if peptide is present, other letters for no peptide 
Signal peptide mostly at the beginning of the protein sequence. 

December 5th
----------------------
Added parsing of the files with BioPython to classes in Python (for loading the dataset).


December 7th
------------------------
Added staticstics for the n, h, c part and splitting into training and testing set. 
Statistics include average length and standard deviation of each part. Serves as a module.

December 8th
-------------------------
Created prototype of the model, saving and loading. 
Prototype is a neural network based, 
Sliding window implemented and data is augmented.

December 10th 
--------------------------
Added human and wild boar proteomes

December 11th
---------------------------
Improving modularity of code

December 14th
---------------------------
First training results with all the data provided are done, with sliding window. Splitting 0.8 of
training and validation, 82% success.


December 26th
---------------------------
Arguments of command line added for robust training of data.
